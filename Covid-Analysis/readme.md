- Real-Time Global COVID-19 Data

- This script retrieves real-time global COVID-19 data using the `requests` library and the API https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all. It fetches the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries and returns the data as a dictionary. This will be the first part of Covid-19 Vizualization we will complete in proj 6
